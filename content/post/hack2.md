Join a global community of students and learn how to code in a collaborative environment. Participate in live meetings to code along with the group.

Ask your questions in the Slack community and participate in Hackathons to build thematic projects with social impact.

Join a Hack Club or create one yourself to lead a members-guided project and attend weekly events.

Follow self-paced workshops and build amazing beginner-friendly projects. The community believes that learning experiences shouldn't be taught like a class, and that's why every project is proposed in a creative and inclusive environment.

Be part of the Hack Club legal entity and gain nonprofit benefits to receive funding for your projects.
